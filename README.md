## Introduction

Microservice SIG is committed to providing a standardized service governance solution for distributed and microservice architecture. This solution consists of specification, realization and best practice. It applies to heterogeneous development and infrastructure such as multi-language, multi-framework, different runtime environments and hybrid cloud scenario.
